# KISMESIS

Kismesis is a static site generator with macros, plugins and spite. Made in rust.

## Features
- **Only one language to type in:** No need to use HTML for one thing, Markdown for another, and maybe something else. The Kiss markup language is designed to complement the static site generator while being concise and easier to type.
- **Compile-time errors:** Aren't you tired of mistyping your pages and realizing later that they've been rendered all wrong? Kismesis will give you a visual report of your erros signaling where they happened, similar to what the Rust compiler does.
- **Macros:** Custom HTML tags you can define in order to use them anywhere. You can supply custom arguments to them.
- **(TO DO!) Plugins:** The current draft of plugins would allow them to do anything they want with the input, making them the most powerful part of Kismesis by far. They will probably be written in Rhine.
- **(TO DO!) A Standard Library:** Ever miss the <marquee> tag? In Kismesis, you're not allowed to use deprecated tags, however it will come with a <marquee?> plugin, which will aim to replicate the behavior using only widely supported featues.
